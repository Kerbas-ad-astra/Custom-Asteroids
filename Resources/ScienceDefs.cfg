	RESULTS

		KerbinInSpace = The asteroid is boiling furiously. You can't get a sample of anything solid.
		MunInSpace = The asteroid is boiling furiously. You can't get a sample of anything solid.
		Minmus = The asteroid is boiling furiously. Maybe you should get some of whatever keeps Minmus's surface from vaporizing.

		DunaInSpace = You only get a sample of the organic bits as the ice vaporizes.
		IkeInSpace = You only get a sample of the organic bits as the ice vaporizes.

		DresInSpace = Gases stream off the sample. Maybe you should put it in the icebox.

		Flying = You collect a sample in midair. The asteroid looks like it's about to explode!
