INSTALLING CUSTOM ASTEROIDS

Copy the contents of this zip's GameData folder to your KSP install's GameData folder, overwriting files if necessary. Your final directory tree should look like
Kerbal Space Program/
	GameData/
		...
		CustomAsteroids/
			config/
			Parts/
			Resources/
			...
		...
		MM_LICENSE.txt
		ModuleManager.2.*.*.dll

If you're not planning to install an asteroid pack from elsewhere, copy the contents of this zip's "Standard Setup" folder to the GameData/CustomAsteroids folder in your KSP install. The new files should all go in the existing GameData/CustomAsteroids/config folder.

You're all set!
